			<p>The official definition of open source software, according to <a href = "http://www.opensource.org">the Open Source Initiative</a>, is software that is freely redistributable,
			   has available source code, and does not discriminate against those who want to contribute to it. This means that people all over the world can contribute to the same piece of 
			   software. There have been many famous open source projects, one of which is the Firefox web browser, developed by Mozilla, and the Linux operating system, coded by Linus Torvalds
			   and many other contributors.</p>
